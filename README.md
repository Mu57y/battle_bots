# battle_bots
A simple, text-based robot fighting game 

You, as the robot, have 3 options: attack, block, and heal. With 100 health, you must defeat the opposing robot (played by the computer) who has the same health and abilities. 

For both you and your assailant:
- Attacking deals 10 damage 
- Blocking blocks the attack
- Healing brings back 10 HP 

Conditions to healing: 
- You can't heal more than 5 times
- You can't heal past 100

Whoever is first to bring their opponent's health to 0 or below shall gain victory. Good luck, and may the best fighter win!
